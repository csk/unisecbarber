# UNIversal SECurity Barber

There are a lot of great security tools which give us A LOT of information 
about the targets we are testing. The problem is that there is no easy way to 
analyse that information because the output of the tools does not follow any 
standard. This project, the "UNIversal SECurity Barber", aims to solve de 
problem building a tool that receives a commandline as an input, parses it to 
know which tool is it suppose to be, modifies it adding arguments / redirecting 
output so it can collect the maximum possible data of it. All the collected 
data is then parsed again and printed out, structured, to the standard output.


It is based on [InfoByte Faraday](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday)
plugins.

## Installation


The easiest way to install the tool is using `pip`.

`pip install git+https://github.com/csk/unisecbarber.git`

Once installed you are ready!

```
$ unisecbarber -h
usage: unisecbarber [-h] [-v] [-o OUTPUT] [-i] [--init] [-d] [-p PLUGIN]
                    [-m MODE] [-l]
                    [cmd_input [cmd_input ...]]

unisecbarber ("UNIversal SECurity Barber") is an effort to normalize sectools
generated data. This tool receives a commandline as an input, parses it to
know which tool it is supposed to be, modifies it adding arguments /
redirecting output so it can collect the maximum possible data of it. All the
collected data is then parsed again and printed out, structured, to the
standard output (by default).

positional arguments:
  cmd_input             command line to execute

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         increase output verbosity
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        store to file
  -i, --input           pass input from stdin to cmd
  --init                force initializiation
  -d, --direct          pass output direct to plugin
  -p PLUGIN, --plugin PLUGIN
                        do not guess. select a specific plugin
  -m MODE, --mode MODE  show mode (`cmd`, `json`)
  -l, --list            list supported tools
