UNIversal SECurity Barber
=========================

There are a lot of great security tools which give us A LOT of information 
about the targets we are testing. The problem is that there is no easy way to 
analyse that information because the output of the tools does not follow any 
standard. This project, the "UNIversal SECurity Barber", aims to solve de 
problem building a tool that receives a commandline as an input, parses it to 
know which tool is it suppose to be, modifies it adding arguments / redirecting 
output so it can collect the maximum possible data of it. All the collected 
data is then parsed again and printed out, structured, to the standard output.


It is based on `InfoByte Faraday <https://github.com/infobyte/faraday>`_ 
plugins.
