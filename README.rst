Sectool Parser Repository
=========================

There are a lot of great security tools which give us A LOT of information about the targets we are testing. The problem is that there is no easy way to analyse that information because the output of the tools does not follow any standard. This project aims to solve building a tool that receives a commandline as an input, parses it to know which tool is it suppose to be, modifies it adding arguments / redirecting output so it can collect the maximum possible data of it. All the data is then parsed and printed out, structured, to the standard output.


It is based on `InfoByte Faraday <https://github.com/infobyte/faraday>`_ plugins.
